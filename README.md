# Bookmarker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lubien/bookmarker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lubien/bookmarker)

This project is designed to convert your Google Chrome's bookmarks into markdown files using the Google chrome extension, Bookmarker. This is a tool built with the Elixir ðŸ’œ programming language and parses your Chrome bookmarks file into a human-readable format. This allows it to be accessible from anywhere, meaning these pages can be viewed even offline since they are stored locally, and can be read easily from any operating system including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Installation

Ensure that you have the Elixir programming language installed which can be found [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
To install Bookmarker, you can use `mix escript.install` from this GitHub repository:

```
`mix escript.install github lubien/bookmarker`
```

## Build

1. Clone this repository and then enter the cloned repo folder.
2. Install the project dependencies using:

```
mix deps.get
```

3. Build the project files:

```
mix escript_build
```

4. Run a usage command to verify that the bookmaker extension is installed properly.
